\section{Introduction}
Virtual machines are very important for more efficiently using computng power. Virtualizing computing power makes it possible to designate the resources where ever it is needed and remove them where they are not. In this project the focus will be on VMDN(Virtual Machine Delivery Networks). More specifically one way to implement the distribution of the virtual machines. The way that is done by trying to reduce the amount of data that is being send by looking what is already installed on the host. By which the amount of time spend downloading files is reduced, but you will gain the amount of time spent for building the virtual machine.

\section{Previous Work}
The project is based on a master thesis which has been previously written for TNO \cite{vmdn1}. This paper introduces VMDNs and proposes 3 different strategies of implementing them. One of the strategies is highlighted in this projected and there will be a made a proof of concept of this strategy.
